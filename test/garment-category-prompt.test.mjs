/* "I tried on JEANS and it put the catalog model's SHIRT on me."

   ROOT CAUSE, and it is not a model hallucination. Under strict image-only conditioning
   (see image-first.test.mjs) every builder returned ONE frozen string, byte-identical for
   every garment in the catalog:

     "Fit a standard t-shirt from the reference image onto the subject ..."

   That sentence is a TOPS anchor. Sent against a trouser packshot it is a direct
   contradiction: the prompt names a t-shirt, the reference photographs a model wearing a
   shirt AND trousers, and nothing anywhere tells the model which half of that reference is
   the product. So Lucy took the whole visual - and the source model's shirt landed on the
   shopper, replacing the real one they were still wearing on camera.

   run.mjs's own suite index already named this gap before it was fixed: "an 'upper
   garment' anchor on a trouser reference is the same contradiction". This suite is that
   contradiction closed.

   THE FIX IS A BRANCH, NOT A NEW CLAUSE. The prompt now resolves per garment category:
   the anchor names the target layer and pins the OPPOSITE layer to the live camera. That
   restores, in the one channel this SDK exposes, what KEEP_TOP/KEEP_BOTTOMS used to do
   before the image-first retirement - but scoped to the anchor itself, where it cannot be
   shed, rather than as one more competing clause.

   WHAT THIS SUITE PINS, and why each is a distinct way for the fix to rot:
     §1  classification: garmentType is AUTHORITATIVE, keywords are the fallback, and
         "short_sleeve" must never read as "shorts" (the obvious regex trap);
     §2  the bottoms prompt isolates the lower garment and preserves the live top;
     §3  the tops prompt isolates the upper garment and preserves the live bottoms;
     §4  neither branch can ever name a t-shirt on a trouser reference again;
     §5  both branches fit PROMPT_MAX_CHARS - the budget is Decart's, not ours, and a
         rejected prompt is a dead session (see clampPromptForWire);
     §6  EVERY builder branches. A single builder left returning a constant is the whole
         bug, reintroduced at one call site - which this file's history records happening
         before, for STRICT_INPAINT.

   Sibling suites: image-first.test.mjs owns the retirement of the assembled clauses and
   the image-anchor contract; outfit-slot-isolation.test.mjs owns the SLOT state that
   decides which builder runs at all. This one owns only the text those two hand to Decart. */
